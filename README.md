## Where am I?
Welcome, weary netizen, to Virtual Dream, a quirky webhost from another time. 

Deliberately janky, confusing to navigate, and brimming with "malware", the sites at VD are meant to be explored blindly. Is there a running thesis for the project? Probably. 

## A Note on Ad-blockers
I love ad-blockers, and I hate ads. That said, I encourage you to disable your ad-blocker when accessing Virtual Dream, as you'll be missing out on a lot of content otherwise. None of the advertisements you'll see lead externally, and are a primary way of discovering new sites!

## FAQ
* **Can I get a virtualdream site?** Probably! Check out the Collaboration section below.

* **Do the emails work?** Yes! Or, at least.. they all should. Send an email and see if someone gets back to you.

* **Is this malware real?** No, any "malware" you come across is purely cosmetic client-side JavaScript and won't affect your browsing experience outside of Virtual Dream. Although, why would you leave?

* **What's the point of all this?**

## Collaboration
The project is open to collaboration, and is accepting submisions for guest sites. If you're interested in creating material, or cleaning up the mess I've built, reach out directly or email [webmaster@virtualdream.live](mailto:webmaster@virtualdream.live)!
