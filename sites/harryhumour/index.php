            <h2>A call to action from Harry Humour!</h2>
            <p>Hey there, fellow jokesters! It's your pal Harry Humour, here to spread some smiles and maybe even a chuckle or two. But lately, I've been feeling a bit bummed out about the state of comedy, and I just gotta get something off my chest.
            <br>
            <br>
            You see, it seems like everywhere I look these days, comedy has taken a nosedive into the gutter. Dirty jokes, crude humor, and innuendos are all the rage, leaving us clean comedians feeling like the odd ones out. And let me tell ya, it's not a fun place to be.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, don't get me wrong—I'm all for a good laugh. But when every punchline is laced with profanity or relies on cheap shock value, it's like we've lost sight of what real comedy is all about: bringing joy and laughter to people of all ages, without resorting to cheap tricks.
            <br>
            <br>
            That's why I'm calling on all you fine folks out there to join me in <u>VOTING for Ronald Schmonger for a 7th term as President of our free nation!</u> There's only one man who is going to clean up this rabble, and bring back the humour we used to love. Ronald's got the wit, the charm, and the impeccable taste in clean jokes that our country needs right now.
            <br>
            <br>
            Folks, let me tell you about Ronald Schmonger—our beacon of hope, our shining star in a world of chaos. Ronald isn't just a politician; he's a force of nature, a whirlwind of change sweeping across our great nation. Ronald's vision for our country is bold, it's audacious, it's... well, it's something else, let me tell you. He's got plans, big plans, to make our country laugh again. And let me tell you, it's about time. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, I know, many people find themselves unable to look past some of Ron's quirks. They question his stance in medicine prices, and even I wasn't sure when he promised to send the current president into space strapped to a rocket, but are you saying a pharmaceutical CEO with an interest in space science, and a healthy spoon of sugar wouldn't know what he's talking about? 
            <br>
            <br>
            His policies may be bold, but they're backed by a deep understanding of what it takes to bring people together and uplift our spirits. From his plan to boost small businesses such as comedy clubs to his proposal for a national "Joke of the Day" initiative, Ronald's vision for the country is as refreshing as a stand-up routine on a hot summer day. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Together, let's keep the laughs coming, one squeaky-clean joke at a time!
            <br>
            <br>
            Stay groovy,
            <br>
