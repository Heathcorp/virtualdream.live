        </p>A memorial to all those sites that were lost during the great Virtual Dream glitch, known as Dream Wipe</p>
        <h3>What is Dream Wipe</h3>
        <p>Dream Wipe was a catastrophic glitch in the system which caused  the majority of Virtual Dream sites to be deleted. Virtual Dream has never publicly commented on what actually happened behind the scenes.</p>
        <h3>Will it happen again?</h3>
        <p>Our overlords at VD have said it won't, but only time will tell. The answer is in whether you trust them or not.</p>
        <p>These images are for all those who remember</p>
