                                Welcome!!! I guess if you don't know this then you're probably new here. Xarxax VII is an animated sci-fi action extravaganza. It is one of the best series I have watched yet, and has fans all around the world! It focuses around Princess Xebulon, and her adventures through space to find the secret to saving her home planet, Xarxax VII (this is what the show is named after!). There are so many fun characters and heartfelt moments between the crew, but it can be pretty scary too. I'd recommend anybody to give it a go! Don't feel too daunted by all the episodes as the pacing is quick, and it really picks up after episode 20.

                                <br>
                                This is such a hard question, since there are so many episodes to pick from, but one that really sits close to my heart is episode 237 (Return to Xarxax VII). I'll tell you I was in tears half the episode seeing Xebulon reunited with her family. The way the music swells when they realise where the wormhole has spat them out gives me tingles every time I watch it. Eek! (Eager eyes may notice I haven't reviewed this episode yet, largely because I have struggled to find the words. One day!).

                                Maybe unsurprisingly, mine is Xebulon :p Who would've guessed, right? I've always had a soft spot for Glorp though.

                                I get this question pretty often, and I'm definitely open to featuring more guest reviewers, but I'm generally pretty picky with spelling and grammar, and I've had to say no a lot of times. If you think you've got something I'd be interested in reading please email me!
