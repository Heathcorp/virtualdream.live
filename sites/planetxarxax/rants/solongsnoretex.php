                        <p><font size="2">If you've been following the site for a while you'd know that neocortex1986 has been my assistant around here since the move to Virtual Dream, and if you've been following even more closely you might notice that he hasn't posted much for a long time. Well today I'm officially sick of it and am <b>removing him as an admin</b> and <b><u>deleting all of his posts</u></b>. Unfortunately, this means a <b><u>lot</u></b> of reviews will be missing, but I think its the right thing to do. If he hasn't deleted his Virtual Dream page you can probably find them there. There is a lot more happening behind the scened but I won't be answering any questions about it. This is not something I wanted to have to do, and I'm so very sad that it had to end this way. <b><u>DO NOT CONTACT ME ABOUT THIS</u></b>.</font></p>
