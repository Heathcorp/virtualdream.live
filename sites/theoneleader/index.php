        <p>Greetings, Netizens. You have arrived at The One Leader's blog. Take your god damn shoes off inside.</p>
        <p>I review all things tech, mostly in the Virtual Dream sphere. I have been into computers since before you were probably alive, and I probably don't give a shit what your opinion is on them.</p>

                        <p>A <a href="https://planetxarxax.virtualdream.live/">new site</a> with the tag planetxarxax has appeared, with rumours circulating that this is likely to be an official site for the famous series, which could mean that fans of the show (see: nerds) are finally getting a central place to flock. Good for them. Maybe they'll do us a favour and stick to that site. Always hated Xarxax.</p>

                        <p>As we all likely know by now Virtual Dream attracts only the "brightest" minds, which is shown no better than by the site's newest inane addition, <a href="https://theporncomputer.virtualdream.live/">Porn Computer</a>. This has got to be the stupidest shit I've seen yet on this website, and I've sifted through all the crap there is on here. This guy is no inventor. Just another moron on the grift. Hopefully VD takes this down before whatever brain worm this guy has spreads.</p>

                        <p>I've never personally been a fan of MalPals. I had always seen them as children's cartoon characters. That was until they released their MalPals browser companions recently. Surfing around while your pal quips and comments really brings a new edge to the experience. I have experienced no hiccups, and no impact to load times. Plus the demo is totally free! What's not to love? <a href="https://malpals.virtualdream.live">Check it out!</a></p>

                        <p>If I wanted to claim the exorbitant insurance money I have on my home and family I would purchase a HyperShitstem. I do not currently plan to do this. Don't be a dumb ass. Capitalise my fucking name. We are not brothers.</p>

                        <p><b>Subject</b>: Clarification on your review of the ConnectTon A3 laptop</p>
                        <p><i>Hi, One Leader, I hope you're doing well.<br> I read your detailed review of the ConnectTon laptop and noticed you mentioned some heating issues during gaming sessions. I wanted to point out that this is actually only relevant to ConnectTon laptops up to A1, and has not been an issue in newer models such as the A3. I've read through their benchmarks and recently purchases an A3 myself and have not experienced any of the issues you mentioned in your review. Not sure if you received a faulty device or are being intentionally disingenous, but you may want to give it another go. <br>Best Regards, Brian</i></p>
                        <p>Firstly, if you're not happy with my reviews there are plenty of other tech sites out there that are <i>HAPPY</i> to pander to the imbecilic market of users who would go anywhere near a ConnectTon device to begin with. Secondly, I'm not even going to grace the bulk of your comments with a proper response, as everyone is aware that these devices are garbage and would be better suited in beating dull-minded tech consumers like yourself over the brain, if they weren't liable to shatter at the slightest touch. I will not be changing my review. In fact, I have removed it entirely (OF MY OWN VOLUTION) to avoid any of your ilk wandering in here like lost little babies. Have a horrible Christmas.</p>
