        <h3>The Leader's Tech Blog</h3>
        <p>Greetings, Netizens. You have arrived at The One Leader's blog. Take your god damn shoes off inside.</p>
        <p>I review all things tech, mostly in the Virtual Dream sphere. I have been into computers since before you were probably alive, and I probably don't give a shit what your opinion is on them.</p>

                        <h3>Xarxax joins Virtual Dream</h3>
                        <p>A <a href="https://planetxarxax.virtualdream.live/">new site</a> with the tag planetxarxax has appeared, with rumours circulating that this is likely to be an official site for the famous series, which could mean that fans of the show (see: nerds) are finally getting a central place to flock. Good for them. Maybe they'll do us a favour and stick to that site. Always hated Xarxax.</p>

                        <h3>Review: Porn Computer</h3>
                        <p>As we all likely know by now Virtual Dream attracts only the "brightest" minds, which is shown no better than by the site's newest inane addition, <a href="https://theporncomputer.virtualdream.live/">Porn Computer</a>. This has got to be the stupidest shit I've seen yet on this website, and I've sifted through all the crap there is on here. This guy is no inventor. Just another moron on the grift. Hopefully VD takes this down before whatever brain worm this guy has spreads.</p>

                        <h3>Review: MalPals - Tubular Triangle</h3>
                        <p>I've never personally been a fan of MalPals. I had always seen them as children's cartoon characters. That was until they released their MalPals browser companions recently. Surfing around while your pal quips and comments really brings a new edge to the experience. I have experienced no hiccups, and no impact to load times. Plus the demo is totally free! What's not to love? <a href="https://malpals.virtualdream.live">Check it out!</a></p>

                        <h3>Review: Malware Cleaner</h3>
                        <p>I'll preface with this: Joey and I do not get along. That said, neither do I get along with all the scum who riddle this site with malware. Call it a lesser of two evils, since <a href="https://malwarecleaner.virtualdream.live">Malware Cleaner</a> does, surprisingly, actually work as it says it does. Something about broken clocks being right.

                        <p><i>Hey leader!<br>I've recently been looking into upgrading my family's home PC and have been eyeing off the HyperSystem X as a pretty decent option. Its not top of the range, but it seems okay enough. Have you had a look into this model? Love your reviews, brother. Thanks!</i></p>
                        <p>If I wanted to claim the exorbitant insurance money I have on my home and family I would purchase a HyperShitstem. I do not currently plan to do this. Don't be a dumb ass. Capitalise my fucking name. We are not brothers.</p>
